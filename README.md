# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the relationship between a city type and the average fare over time in order to determine where we should focus our efforts. We do so by examining Ride-share data such as the total number of rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

Results

Looking at the diagram below, we can make several observations. We can see that we receive the greatest amount of fares overall from rides that take place in Urban cities, followed by Suburban cities, and finally Rural cities. Now this is to be expected since there's a greater consumer base in cities so it stands to reason there would be more incidences of people using our ride-sharing service to get to where they need to go. 

Looking at the amount of fares over the first few months of the year, you can see that there is a significant drop in fares in the month of April, which is something that we should dedicate additional resources to determine the root cause.
