# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the relationship between a city type and the average fare over time in order to determine where we should focus our efforts. We do so by examining Ride-share data such as the total number of rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
